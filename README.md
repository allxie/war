###The Rules of War
When a new game is started, the deck is shuffled and each player is dealt half the deck. Each player flips the top card from their deck at the same time to reaveal it. Whomever's card has the higher number gets to put both cards on the bottom of their deck. If the numbers are the same, the players each place three cards from the top of their deck facedown on the table, and flip a fourth card. Whichever player has the card of those two are higher wins the all of those facedown cards and the played cards. Repeat for another tie. A player wins when the other player has no cards left to play.
